# GymFlow — Competitor Overview

> **Market**: Gym & fitness centre management software, Egypt + MENA
> **Our angle**: Arabic-first, built for the local market, no per-member pricing traps

---

## The Competitive Landscape

The gym software market is dominated by Western platforms built for English-speaking markets — they're expensive, complex, and have little to no Arabic support. Local gym owners in Egypt and MENA are currently using either:
- Spreadsheets / WhatsApp
- Expensive international tools that don't fit how they work
- Old desktop software with no mobile access

GymFlow's opportunity is the gap between "nothing" and "overpriced international SaaS."

## Key Competitors

### 1. Mindbody
**HQ**: USA | **Pricing**: ~$139–$599/month | **Arabic support**: None

The biggest name in fitness software globally. Built for large studios and wellness businesses — far too complex and expensive for a typical Egyptian gym. English-only, USD pricing, and designed around class booking more than access control. No meaningful MENA presence.

**GymFlow advantage**: 10–50x cheaper, Arabic-first, simpler UX built for gym staff, not studio managers.

---

### 2. Gymmaster
**HQ**: New Zealand | **Pricing**: ~$75–$249/month | **Arabic support**: None

Popular mid-market gym management tool. Has mobile check-in and member portals, but again entirely English. Pricing in USD with no regional payment options. Support is in a completely different timezone from Egypt.

**GymFlow advantage**: Local pricing (EGP-aware), Arabic UI, WhatsApp integration built in — which is how MENA gyms actually communicate with members.

---

### 3. Glofox
**HQ**: Ireland | **Pricing**: ~$110–$150+/month | **Arabic support**: None

Positioned as a "premium" gym software with a slick branded member app. Strong marketing but expensive for what most gym owners actually need. Heavily focused on boutique fitness studios and class schedules — not traditional gym access control.

**GymFlow advantage**: We focus on the core job: check-ins, memberships, and revenue tracking. No bloat. Half the price.

---

### 4. Wodify
**HQ**: USA | **Pricing**: ~$99–$299/month | **Arabic support**: None

Built specifically for CrossFit and functional fitness gyms. Very niche. Overkill for a standard gym or health club.

**GymFlow advantage**: General-purpose gym management with QR check-in, card scanning, and WhatsApp reminders — features that matter to Egyptian gym owners specifically.

---

### 5. Local Desktop Software (legacy)
Various unlicensed or locally-built desktop apps still widely used in Egypt. No cloud backup, no mobile access, data stuck on one PC, no WhatsApp integration.

**GymFlow advantage**: Cloud-based PWA — works on any device, auto-backup, offline check-in sync, and installs like an app on any phone without an app store.
