## Full Description (250 words)

GymFlow is a cloud-based gym management platform built specifically for gyms in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the MENA region.

**The problem**: Gym owners spend hours on manual member tracking, missed renewals, and spreadsheet reports. Front desk queues slow down morning rushes. Members lapse without reminders.

**The solution**: GymFlow automates the entire gym operation:

- **QR Code Check-in** — Members scan a QR code at entry. Expired subscriptions are denied automatically. No hardware needed.
- **WhatsApp Notifications** — Automated renewal reminders sent 7, 3, and 1 day before expiry. Welcome messages for new members. 98% open rate vs 20% for email.
- **Subscription Management** — Flexible plans with session quotas, auto-renewal, subscription freeze, and price tiers.
- **Real-time Reports** — Attendance trends, revenue breakdown, peak hours, at-risk members, and denied entries in one dashboard.
- **Multi-branch Support** — One account for all locations. Per-branch staff access and reporting.
- **Cloud Backup** — Daily automated backups with one-click restore.

**What makes GymFlow different**:
- Arabic-first UI with full RTL support (also works in English)
- WhatsApp integration (not email or SMS — the channel MENA members actually use)
- QR check-in with no additional hardware
- Cloud-native on Google Cloud infrastructure
- Offline mode for unreliable internet connections
- Affordable pricing designed for the MENA market

GymFlow serves gyms ranging from single-location independent studios to multi-branch chains across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.
