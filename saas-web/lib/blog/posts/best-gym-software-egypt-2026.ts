Software that ignores this creates friction at every step.",

  faq: [
    {
      q: "What is the best gym management software in Egypt?",
      a: "GymFlow is the best gym management software for Egyptian gyms in 2026. It is the only platform that combines full Arabic UI, QR code check-in, automated WhatsApp messaging, and cloud-based access in a single affordable subscription priced in EGP.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is there gym software that supports Arabic in Egypt?",
      a: "Yes. GymFlow, Egypt Gym Manager, Fekrait, and Daftra all support Arabic. However, GymFlow is the only one with full right-to-left Arabic UI combined with gym-specific features like QR check-in and WhatsApp automation.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does gym software in Egypt support WhatsApp integration?",
      a: "GymFlow is currently the only gym management platform designed for Egypt that includes built-in WhatsApp automation — automatically sending renewal reminders, welcome messages, and expiry warnings to members via WhatsApp.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much does gym management software cost in Egypt?",
      a: "Prices vary widely. Egypt Gym Manager is a one-time desktop purchase around 300 EGP. GymFlow starts from approximately 500 EGP/month as a cloud subscription. International platforms like Mindbody start at $129/month USD, which at current exchange rates makes them impractical for most Egyptian gym budgets.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use Mindbody or similar Western gym software in Egypt?",
      a: "Technically yes, but it is generally a poor fit. Mindbody and similar Western platforms have no Arabic support, charge in USD, and are designed for credit-card billing and English-speaking members. For Egyptian gyms, a purpose-built Arabic platform like GymFlow will save time, reduce staff errors, and better serve your members.",
